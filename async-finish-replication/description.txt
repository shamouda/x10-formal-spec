(* Don't ignore backup failure: assuming client updated master version from v0 to v1, then master died
   Then backup recreated a new master with version v0, then the backup died
   Now if the client ignore the backup failure, the master version will be zero, which is not correct,
   It should be version 1    
   Client must repeat the request if it detects that the backup failed, but is it possible that this cause the action to occur twice? *)
(* Blocking requests: getNewMaster and getNewBackup. The replica getting one of these requests should not respond until it rereplicates
   We do so by sending the already known identity and if still not changed we don't respond to the client *)
(* Client does not die *)
(* We assume all failure reporting by the system is 100% accurate, no false positives *)
(* The client's only way to know about the backup id is through the master, if masterDoFailed, must search for backup*)
